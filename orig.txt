In the OpenOffice.org API, a text document is a document model which is able to handle text contents. A document in our context is a product of work that can be stored and printed to make the result of the work a permanent resource. By model we mean data that forms the basis of a document and is organized in a manner that allows working with the data independently from their visual representation in a graphical user interface.
